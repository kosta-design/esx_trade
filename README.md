# esx_trade
**FEATURES**
* Buy or trade items
* Sell items

**INFORMATION**
*This script is fully configurable. (Maybe it doesn't look understandable but its not complicated)*
*You can configure this script as much as you want. Just donâ€™t sell it or republish. Thanks*

*Script is edited version of "esx_pawnshop". Couldn't find the original owner of the script to give credits. In the original you could only buy/sell items for in-game money. I've just added option to trade item. (e.g., trade "metalscrap" and "gun_powder for "clip")*

```
Config.PawnTradeItem = true --If 'true' players trade item for item, if 'false' player trade item for money - money for item
